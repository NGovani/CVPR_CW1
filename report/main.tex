\section{Image Collection}

\paragraph{Task 1} We were instructed to capture to sets of images. The subject of both sets was an object placed in a 3D calibration grid and the difference between the two sets was the type of transformation between the images in said set. The first set \textbf{FD}, has images which horizontally pivoted around the grid, whilst the second set \textbf{HG}, contained images taken from the same position but with varying zoom and rotation. See Appendix \ref{apx:fd} and Appendix \ref{apx:hg} for the \textbf{FD} and \textbf{HG} sets respectively.

\section{Correspondence Analysis}

\paragraph{In this task,} we were told to compare two methods of correspondence matching, automatic and manual, with two metrics being asked for: quality and quantity. 

Each coursework task should have its section in this report. It should include outputs specified in task description e.g. figures or tables, and a discussion of each presented figure or table e.g. the main observations and their explanation. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Table~\ref{table:1}, {\ Figures, graphs, and photographs/} 
All graphics should be centred.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print. 



\begin{table}[]
   \begin{tabular}{c|l|lll}
   \multirow{2}{*}{Method} & \multirow{2}{*}{Quantity} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Quality}                                    \\ \cline{3-5} 
                           &                           & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Mean} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Median} & Skew \\ \hline
   Manual                  & tmp                       & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{tmp}  & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{tmp}    & tmp  \\
   Automatic (KAZE)        & tmp                       & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{tmp}  & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{tmp}    & tmp 
   \end{tabular}
   \medbreak
   \caption{T1.2 Results of.... }
   \label{table:1}
\end{table}

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
